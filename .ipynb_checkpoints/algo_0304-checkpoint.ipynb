    "Review the paper: The paper describes the \"Energy Aware VM Available Time (EAVMAT)\" scheduling algorithm, where tasks like AR or IM requests are processed based on the availability of active or idle hosts. If no host is available, the system preempts existing requests. The main goal is to minimize the number of active servers for energy conservation.\n",

    "The image.png contains the VM specifications (e.g., CPU, memory, and other characteristics of each VM).\n",
    "The final_df_sum_no_missing_hour_filled.csv contains the workload data (e.g., job request times, resource requirements).\n",
    "Desired Outcome: I want you to apply the model described in the paper using the VM and workload data. Based on the paper’s algorithm, you should allocate resources, prioritize AR/IM jobs, and generate results that minimize the number of active servers while properly scheduling jobs.\n",

    "The number of servers that were turned on during each time period.\n",

However, I don’t have direct access to upload or process files like images or CSV files in this format. Could you please share the key details from the VM specifications (e.g., CPU, memory, and other characteristics of each VM) and the workload data (e.g., job request times, resource requirements, AR/IM job types) in text form? Once I have this information, I can simulate the EAVMAT scheduling algorithm described in the paper, allocate resources, prioritize AR/IM jobs, and generate the desired output while minimizing the number of active servers.\n",

    "Process VM Specifications: I’ll use the VM characteristics (e.g., CPU, memory) to determine resource availability for job allocation.\n",
    "Analyze Workload Data: I’ll use the job request times, resource requirements, and job types (AR/IM) to schedule jobs optimally.\n",

Let’s break this down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "VM Specifications for node-11 (Dell PowerEdge R730)\n",
    "CPU: Intel Xeon CPU E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz\n",
    "CPU Cores: 22 cores x 2 (44 total cores)\n",
    "Memory: 512 GB\n",
    "GPU: None listed (so we’ll assume no GPU for this node, unlike node-32)\n",
    "Power Consumption: 1100 Watts x 2 (2200 Watts total, presumably in active state)\n",
    "Workload Data\n",
    "The workload data provided seems to be for node-32 (given the GPU metrics), but we’ll assume it’s representative of a similar workload pattern for node-11, adjusting for the lack of GPU. The workload data includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time: Four hourly intervals on November 4, 2024 (14:00, 15:00, 16:00, 17:00)\n",
    "CPU Metrics:\n",
    "cpu_load: Current CPU load\n",
    "cpu_alloc: Allocated CPU units\n",
    "cpu_idle: Idle CPU units\n",
    "cpu_total: Total CPU units (464.0 in your data)\n",
    "GPU Metrics: Not applicable for node-11, as it has no GPU.\n",
    "For simplicity, we’ll focus on the CPU-related metrics and assume the workload represents job requests that need to be scheduled on node-11’s VMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mapping Your Data to the Paper’s Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper proposes an energy-aware job scheduling algorithm (EAVMAT) that minimizes energy consumption by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying jobs into three types: Advance Reservation (AR), Immediate (IM), and Best Effort (BE).\n",
    "Using preemption to prioritize AR and IM jobs over BE jobs.\n",
    "Assigning jobs to existing active hosts to minimize the number of active hosts, reducing energy use.\n",
    "Managing host states (Active, Idle, Standby) with specific power consumption levels.\n",
    "Assumptions from the Paper Applied to node-11\n",
    "Host States:\n",
    "Active (A): High-energy state (e.g., 2200 Watts for node-11, based on your data).\n",
    "Idle: Consumes ~70% of active power (2200 * 0.7 = 1540 Watts).\n",
    "Standby: Consumes ~10% of active power (2200 * 0.1 = 220 Watts).\n",
    "Initial State: 50% of hosts start in Idle, 50% in Standby (if we assume node-11 is part of a datacenter with multiple hosts, but for simplicity, we’ll treat it as a single host).\n",
    "Job Types: We’ll need to infer or assign job types (AR, IM, BE) to your workload data, as it’s not explicitly provided. For now, we’ll assume the workload represents a mix of job types based on CPU load patterns.\n",
    "Idle Time Threshold (I_th): Set by the administrator (not provided in your data, so we’ll use a placeholder value, e.g., 30 minutes).\n",
    "Minimum Number of Idle Hosts (MinNum): Also set by the administrator (assume 1 for a single-host scenario like node-11).\n",
    "VM Configuration for node-11\n",
    "The paper assumes VMs of different sizes (small, medium, large, X-large) based on the number of cores. For node-11 (44 cores total), we can assume:\n",
    "Multiple VMs sharing the 44 cores (e.g., 4 large VMs with 11 cores each, or a mix of smaller VMs).\n",
    "Each VM has access to a portion of the 512 GB memory.\n",
    "Since no GPU is listed, we’ll focus solely on CPU and memory allocation.\n",
    "3. Applying the EAVMAT Algorithm to Your Workload\n",
    "\n",
    "The EAVMAT algorithm (Algorithm 2 in the paper) schedules jobs based on their type (AR, IM, BE) and the earliest available time (EAT) of VMs on active or idle hosts. Here’s how we can apply it to your workload data for node-11:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Classify Jobs from Your Workload Data\n",
    "Your workload data shows CPU load, allocation, idle, and total metrics over time. We’ll interpret these as job requests arriving at each hourly interval. Since job types aren’t specified, let’s make reasonable assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "AR Jobs: High-priority, deadline-sensitive jobs (e.g., assume 20% of the workload, as suggested in the paper’s simulation, with fixed start and end times).\n",
    "IM Jobs: Immediate, time-sensitive jobs (e.g., 30% of the workload, requiring immediate allocation).\n",
    "BE Jobs: Low-priority, non-deadline-sensitive jobs (e.g., 50% of the workload, queued if resources aren’t available).\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "At 14:00, cpu_load = 338.745, cpu_alloc = 363.0, cpu_idle = 101.0, cpu_total = 464.0.\n",
    "Assume 20% (67.75 CPU units) are AR jobs, 30% (101.63 CPU units) are IM jobs, and 50% (169.37 CPU units) are BE jobs.\n",
    "These are hypothetical allocations; you’d need actual job characteristics to refine this.\n",
    "Step 2: Check Resource Availability\n",
    "Total CPU Capacity: 44 cores x (assume 2.20 GHz/core, but for simplicity, use CPU units as in your data, 464.0 total units).\n",
    "Current Utilization: At 14:00, 338.745 units are loaded, leaving 125.255 units idle (464.0 - 338.745).\n",
    "VM Availability: Assume node-11 has multiple VMs (e.g., 4 VMs with 11 cores each, totaling 44 cores). Each VM’s available time (AT) is based on when its current jobs finish.\n",
    "Step 3: Apply EAVMAT Scheduling\n",
    "Using the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each incoming job at 14:00, 15:00, etc.:\n",
    "If it’s a BE request: Schedule on a free VM if available, or queue it if not (backfill queue).\n",
    "If it’s an IM request: Schedule immediately on a free VM, or preempt a BE job if necessary.\n",
    "If it’s an AR request: Schedule on a VM with resources available at the specified start time, preempting BE jobs if needed, or reject if no resources are available.\n",
    "Preemption: If an AR or IM job arrives and no free VM is available, preempt a BE job from the queue or executing on a VM, scheduling the higher-priority job.\n",
    "State Transitions:\n",
    "If node-11 is idle and a job arrives, transition to Active (2200 Watts).\n",
    "If no jobs are queued or running (RQ_k = ∅ and JQ = ∅), transition back to Idle (1540 Watts) after the idle time threshold (I_th).\n",
    "If idle for too long (> I_th, e.g., 30 minutes), transition to Standby (220 Watts).\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate Energy Consumption\n",

    "Energy Savings: Using EAVMAT, you could save 2%–46% energy compared to a non-energy-aware approach, depending on the system load. For node-11, this could mean reducing power consumption from 8,800 Watt-hours to as low as 4,752 Watt-hours over 4 hours, based on the paper’s findings.\n",
    "Performance: The algorithm improves CPU utilization and success rate by prioritizing AR and IM jobs, potentially handling more jobs on node-11 without increasing the number of active hosts.\n",
    "Limitations: Since node-11 lacks a GPU, we can’t apply GPU-related metrics. Also, without explicit job types or VM configurations, the analysis is approximate. You’d need detailed job characteristics (e.g., start/end times, core/memory requirements) to refine the scheduling.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data Loading: Uses pandas to load your start and end resource data. Since end resources are identical to start resources, we assume jobs persist for 1 hour each.\n",
    "Node Class: Represents a node (e.g., node-11, node-13, node-14) with states (Active, Idle, Standby), resource usage (CPU, GPU), and power consumption.\n",
    "Job Classification: Distributes CPU load into AR (20%), IM (30%), and BE (50%) jobs based on the paper’s simulation.\n",
    "EAVMAT Algorithm: Implements the paper’s logic to schedule jobs on active or idle nodes, prioritizing AR/IM over BE, with preemption for BE jobs if needed. It minimizes active hosts to save energy.\n",
    "Energy Calculation: Uses the paper’s energy model to calculate consumption based on node states over 4 hours (240 minutes).\n",
    "Metrics: Tracks energy consumption, job success rate, and number of active hosts.\n",
    "4. Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Install required libraries:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy\n",
    "Save the script (e.g., eavmat_scheduler.py) and run it:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "python eavmat_scheduler.py\n",
    "5. Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will show:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total energy consumption in Watt-minutes (e.g., ~1,056,000 Watt-minutes if all nodes stay Active for 4 hours, with potential savings per the paper’s 2%–46%).\n",
    "Job success rate (e.g., ~80–90%, depending on resource availability).\n",
    "Number of active hosts (e.g., 1–3, depending on scheduling).\n",
    "6. Limitations and Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifications: The code assumes uniform node specs (node-32 for all), identical start/end resources, and fixed job distribution. Refine these based on actual data or needs.\n",
    "GPU Handling: The code uses GPU metrics, but you mentioned node-11 has no GPU. You can modify the code to ignore GPU metrics for nodes without GPUs or adjust node specs accordingly.\n",
    "Preemption Logic: The preemption is simplified; you might want to add more detailed rules based on job priorities or deadlines.\n",
    "Scalability: For a larger datacenter, extend the code to handle more nodes, VM migration (if needed), and dynamic state transitions.\n",
    "Would you like to refine any part of this code or add specific features (e.g., detailed preemption, VM sizing, or GPU adjustments for node-11)? Let me know! 😄\n",

    "Sub-nodes (e.g., node-15, node-16, node-151–node-168, node-141, node-171, node-172): These are listed under ESXi hosts (esxi-31, esxi-33, esxi-34, esxi-35, esxi-36, esxi-37). I assumed they inherit the memory and power specs of their parent ESXi host where not explicitly stated (marked with *). For example, node-15 under esxi-31 inherits 256 GB memory and 1600 Watts power. If these values differ, please provide the specific details.\n",
    "Power for Sub-nodes: For sub-nodes with incomplete power data, I assumed they use the same power as their parent ESXi host (e.g., 1600 Watts for esxi-31 nodes, 2200 Watts for esxi-33/esxi-34 nodes, etc.). Adjust these if actual power consumption differs.\n",
    "GPU Details: Some sub-nodes have GPUs (e.g., node-15, node-16 have 1 NVIDIA Tesla V100), while others don’t (e.g., node-151, node-156). I preserved the GPU counts as provided, assuming no GPU where not listed.\n",
    "Memory for Sub-nodes: Assumed sub-nodes share the parent ESXi host’s memory (e.g., 256 GB for esxi-31, 128 GB for esxi-36/esxi-37) unless otherwise specified. If sub-nodes have different memory allocations, provide those details.\n",
    "How This Updates the Previous Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll use these updated specs in any future Python code or analysis. For example, the previous script assumed all nodes used node-32 specs, but now we’ll differentiate between nodes (e.g., node-11, node-12, node-13, node-14 have different CPU cores, memory, and no GPUs, while esxi-31, esxi-33, etc., have GPUs).\n",
    "If you want me to update the Python code from the previous response to incorporate these new node specs, I can modify it to handle heterogeneous nodes, GPU usage, and varying power consumption. Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with that or focus on something specific!\n",
    "Would you like me to proceed with updating the Python code, analyze a specific subset of nodes, or address any other aspect of this data? 😄\n",

    "\n",
    "Node Specifications:\n",
    "Updated NODE_SPEC to include all nodes from your new list, with their respective CPU cores, memory, GPU details, and power consumption (Active, Idle, Standby).\n",
    "Sub-nodes (e.g., node-15, node-16, node-151–node-168) inherit memory and power from their parent ESXi hosts where not specified, as noted in the previous response.\n",
    "GPU memory is approximated (e.g., 11GB for RTX2080Ti, 12GB for RTX3080, 16GB for Tesla V100) for simplicity; adjust if actual values differ.\n",
    "Workload Data:\n",
    "Loaded the new workload data for 15:00–16:00 on November 4, 2024, with per-node CPU and GPU metrics.\n",
    "Assumed jobs persist for 1 hour (from 15:00 to 16:00), as per your start/end times.\n",
    "Classified jobs into AR (20%), IM (30%), and BE (50%) based on cpu_load for each node.\n",
    "EAVMAT Algorithm:\n",
    "Modified to handle heterogeneous nodes, checking CPU and GPU capacity for each node before scheduling.\n",
    "Prioritizes scheduling on the specific node listed in the workload, then falls back to other active/idle nodes if needed.\n",
    "Includes preemption for BE jobs to accommodate AR/IM jobs, as per the paper’s algorithm.\n",
    "Calculates energy consumption over 1 hour (60 minutes) instead of 4 hours, reflecting the new workload duration.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Reports total energy consumption (Watt-minutes), job success rate (%), and number of active hosts.\n",
    "Lists each node’s state, CPU usage, GPU power usage, and power consumption for debugging.\n",
    "Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Install required libraries:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy\n",

    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "python eavmat_scheduler_updated.py\n",
    "Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will vary based on resource availability and scheduling decisions, but you might see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Energy Consumption: ~200,000–400,000 Watt-minutes (depending on active nodes and their power consumption).\n",
    "Job Success Rate: ~80–95% (depending on whether all jobs can be scheduled or require preemption).\n",
    "Number of Active Hosts: Likely 10–15 nodes, as many nodes have non-zero CPU loads at 15:00.\n",
    "Each node’s state, CPU usage, GPU power usage, and power consumption will be listed for detailed insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations and Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU Load: The GPU load calculation is simplified (e.g., gpu_power_used = job_load * 10). You can refine this based on actual GPU metrics (e.g., gpu_gpu_usage, gpu_mem_used).\n",
    "Sub-node Assumptions: Memory and power for sub-nodes (e.g., node-15, node-151) are assumed to match their parent ESXi hosts. Update if these differ.\n",
    "Job Classification: The 20%/30%/50% distribution for AR/IM/BE is assumed. Provide actual job types if available for more accuracy.\n",
    "Scalability: For larger workloads or more complex preemption rules, you might need to optimize the code or add VM-level scheduling.\n",
    "Let me know if you want to refine any part of this, add specific features, or analyze additional metrics! 😄\n",

    "由于 PSO 在云调度中的应用较为复杂，这里仅实现了一个简化的版本，专注于能量优化。您可以进一步优化（如增加粒子数量、迭代次数，或更复杂的适应度函数）。\n",
    "Round Robin (RR)：\n",
    "RR 算法按顺序轮流分配作业到可用节点，确保每个节点公平地处理作业。\n",
    "这里使用循环方式分配作业，如果当前节点不可用，则尝试下一个节点，并支持 AR/IM 作业的抢占 BE 作业。\n",

    "GPU 负载：GPU 使用仍为简化版（gpu_power_used = job_load * 10），建议根据实际 gpu_gpu_usage 和 gpu_mem_used 优化。\n",
    "性能度量：可以添加更多指标（如平均响应时间、等待时间）以更全面地比较算法。\n",

Let’s break this down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "VM Specifications for node-11 (Dell PowerEdge R730)\n",
    "CPU: Intel Xeon CPU E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz\n",
    "CPU Cores: 22 cores x 2 (44 total cores)\n",
    "Memory: 512 GB\n",
    "GPU: None listed (so we’ll assume no GPU for this node, unlike node-32)\n",
    "Power Consumption: 1100 Watts x 2 (2200 Watts total, presumably in active state)\n",
    "Workload Data\n",
    "The workload data provided seems to be for node-32 (given the GPU metrics), but we’ll assume it’s representative of a similar workload pattern for node-11, adjusting for the lack of GPU. The workload data includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time: Four hourly intervals on November 4, 2024 (14:00, 15:00, 16:00, 17:00)\n",
    "CPU Metrics:\n",
    "cpu_load: Current CPU load\n",
    "cpu_alloc: Allocated CPU units\n",
    "cpu_idle: Idle CPU units\n",
    "cpu_total: Total CPU units (464.0 in your data)\n",
    "GPU Metrics: Not applicable for node-11, as it has no GPU.\n",
    "For simplicity, we’ll focus on the CPU-related metrics and assume the workload represents job requests that need to be scheduled on node-11’s VMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mapping Your Data to the Paper’s Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper proposes an energy-aware job scheduling algorithm (EAVMAT) that minimizes energy consumption by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying jobs into three types: Advance Reservation (AR), Immediate (IM), and Best Effort (BE).\n",
    "Using preemption to prioritize AR and IM jobs over BE jobs.\n",
    "Assigning jobs to existing active hosts to minimize the number of active hosts, reducing energy use.\n",
    "Managing host states (Active, Idle, Standby) with specific power consumption levels.\n",
    "Assumptions from the Paper Applied to node-11\n",
    "Host States:\n",
    "Active (A): High-energy state (e.g., 2200 Watts for node-11, based on your data).\n",
    "Idle: Consumes ~70% of active power (2200 * 0.7 = 1540 Watts).\n",
    "Standby: Consumes ~10% of active power (2200 * 0.1 = 220 Watts).\n",
    "Initial State: 50% of hosts start in Idle, 50% in Standby (if we assume node-11 is part of a datacenter with multiple hosts, but for simplicity, we’ll treat it as a single host).\n",
    "Job Types: We’ll need to infer or assign job types (AR, IM, BE) to your workload data, as it’s not explicitly provided. For now, we’ll assume the workload represents a mix of job types based on CPU load patterns.\n",
    "Idle Time Threshold (I_th): Set by the administrator (not provided in your data, so we’ll use a placeholder value, e.g., 30 minutes).\n",
    "Minimum Number of Idle Hosts (MinNum): Also set by the administrator (assume 1 for a single-host scenario like node-11).\n",
    "VM Configuration for node-11\n",
    "The paper assumes VMs of different sizes (small, medium, large, X-large) based on the number of cores. For node-11 (44 cores total), we can assume:\n",
    "Multiple VMs sharing the 44 cores (e.g., 4 large VMs with 11 cores each, or a mix of smaller VMs).\n",
    "Each VM has access to a portion of the 512 GB memory.\n",
    "Since no GPU is listed, we’ll focus solely on CPU and memory allocation.\n",
    "3. Applying the EAVMAT Algorithm to Your Workload\n",
    "\n",
    "The EAVMAT algorithm (Algorithm 2 in the paper) schedules jobs based on their type (AR, IM, BE) and the earliest available time (EAT) of VMs on active or idle hosts. Here’s how we can apply it to your workload data for node-11:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Classify Jobs from Your Workload Data\n",
    "Your workload data shows CPU load, allocation, idle, and total metrics over time. We’ll interpret these as job requests arriving at each hourly interval. Since job types aren’t specified, let’s make reasonable assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "AR Jobs: High-priority, deadline-sensitive jobs (e.g., assume 20% of the workload, as suggested in the paper’s simulation, with fixed start and end times).\n",
    "IM Jobs: Immediate, time-sensitive jobs (e.g., 30% of the workload, requiring immediate allocation).\n",
    "BE Jobs: Low-priority, non-deadline-sensitive jobs (e.g., 50% of the workload, queued if resources aren’t available).\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "At 14:00, cpu_load = 338.745, cpu_alloc = 363.0, cpu_idle = 101.0, cpu_total = 464.0.\n",
    "Assume 20% (67.75 CPU units) are AR jobs, 30% (101.63 CPU units) are IM jobs, and 50% (169.37 CPU units) are BE jobs.\n",
    "These are hypothetical allocations; you’d need actual job characteristics to refine this.\n",
    "Step 2: Check Resource Availability\n",
    "Total CPU Capacity: 44 cores x (assume 2.20 GHz/core, but for simplicity, use CPU units as in your data, 464.0 total units).\n",
    "Current Utilization: At 14:00, 338.745 units are loaded, leaving 125.255 units idle (464.0 - 338.745).\n",
    "VM Availability: Assume node-11 has multiple VMs (e.g., 4 VMs with 11 cores each, totaling 44 cores). Each VM’s available time (AT) is based on when its current jobs finish.\n",
    "Step 3: Apply EAVMAT Scheduling\n",
    "Using the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each incoming job at 14:00, 15:00, etc.:\n",
    "If it’s a BE request: Schedule on a free VM if available, or queue it if not (backfill queue).\n",
    "If it’s an IM request: Schedule immediately on a free VM, or preempt a BE job if necessary.\n",
    "If it’s an AR request: Schedule on a VM with resources available at the specified start time, preempting BE jobs if needed, or reject if no resources are available.\n",
    "Preemption: If an AR or IM job arrives and no free VM is available, preempt a BE job from the queue or executing on a VM, scheduling the higher-priority job.\n",
    "State Transitions:\n",
    "If node-11 is idle and a job arrives, transition to Active (2200 Watts).\n",
    "If no jobs are queued or running (RQ_k = ∅ and JQ = ∅), transition back to Idle (1540 Watts) after the idle time threshold (I_th).\n",
    "If idle for too long (> I_th, e.g., 30 minutes), transition to Standby (220 Watts).\n",

    "Energy Savings: Using EAVMAT, you could save 2%–46% energy compared to a non-energy-aware approach, depending on the system load. For node-11, this could mean reducing power consumption from 8,800 Watt-hours to as low as 4,752 Watt-hours over 4 hours, based on the paper’s findings.\n",
    "Performance: The algorithm improves CPU utilization and success rate by prioritizing AR and IM jobs, potentially handling more jobs on node-11 without increasing the number of active hosts.\n",
    "Limitations: Since node-11 lacks a GPU, we can’t apply GPU-related metrics. Also, without explicit job types or VM configurations, the analysis is approximate. You’d need detailed job characteristics (e.g., start/end times, core/memory requirements) to refine the scheduling.\n",

    "Define administrator-set parameters like I_th and MinNum for your datacenter.\n",
    "If you have multiple nodes or a datacenter setup, we can extend the model to include host consolidation and state transitions across nodes.\n",

    "3. Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading: Uses pandas to load your start and end resource data. Since end resources are identical to start resources, we assume jobs persist for 1 hour each.\n",
    "Node Class: Represents a node (e.g., node-11, node-13, node-14) with states (Active, Idle, Standby), resource usage (CPU, GPU), and power consumption.\n",
    "Job Classification: Distributes CPU load into AR (20%), IM (30%), and BE (50%) jobs based on the paper’s simulation.\n",
    "EAVMAT Algorithm: Implements the paper’s logic to schedule jobs on active or idle nodes, prioritizing AR/IM over BE, with preemption for BE jobs if needed. It minimizes active hosts to save energy.\n",
    "Energy Calculation: Uses the paper’s energy model to calculate consumption based on node states over 4 hours (240 minutes).\n",
    "Metrics: Tracks energy consumption, job success rate, and number of active hosts.\n",
    "4. Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Install required libraries:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy\n",
    "Save the script (e.g., eavmat_scheduler.py) and run it:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "python eavmat_scheduler.py\n",
    "5. Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will show:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total energy consumption in Watt-minutes (e.g., ~1,056,000 Watt-minutes if all nodes stay Active for 4 hours, with potential savings per the paper’s 2%–46%).\n",
    "Job success rate (e.g., ~80–90%, depending on resource availability).\n",
    "Number of active hosts (e.g., 1–3, depending on scheduling).\n",
    "6. Limitations and Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifications: The code assumes uniform node specs (node-32 for all), identical start/end resources, and fixed job distribution. Refine these based on actual data or needs.\n",
    "GPU Handling: The code uses GPU metrics, but you mentioned node-11 has no GPU. You can modify the code to ignore GPU metrics for nodes without GPUs or adjust node specs accordingly.\n",
    "Preemption Logic: The preemption is simplified; you might want to add more detailed rules based on job priorities or deadlines.\n",
    "Scalability: For a larger datacenter, extend the code to handle more nodes, VM migration (if needed), and dynamic state transitions.\n",
    "Would you like to refine any part of this code or add specific features (e.g., detailed preemption, VM sizing, or GPU adjustments for node-11)? Let me know! 😄\n",

    "Sub-nodes (e.g., node-15, node-16, node-151–node-168, node-141, node-171, node-172): These are listed under ESXi hosts (esxi-31, esxi-33, esxi-34, esxi-35, esxi-36, esxi-37). I assumed they inherit the memory and power specs of their parent ESXi host where not explicitly stated (marked with *). For example, node-15 under esxi-31 inherits 256 GB memory and 1600 Watts power. If these values differ, please provide the specific details.\n",
    "Power for Sub-nodes: For sub-nodes with incomplete power data, I assumed they use the same power as their parent ESXi host (e.g., 1600 Watts for esxi-31 nodes, 2200 Watts for esxi-33/esxi-34 nodes, etc.). Adjust these if actual power consumption differs.\n",
    "GPU Details: Some sub-nodes have GPUs (e.g., node-15, node-16 have 1 NVIDIA Tesla V100), while others don’t (e.g., node-151, node-156). I preserved the GPU counts as provided, assuming no GPU where not listed.\n",
    "Memory for Sub-nodes: Assumed sub-nodes share the parent ESXi host’s memory (e.g., 256 GB for esxi-31, 128 GB for esxi-36/esxi-37) unless otherwise specified. If sub-nodes have different memory allocations, provide those details.\n",
    "How This Updates the Previous Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll use these updated specs in any future Python code or analysis. For example, the previous script assumed all nodes used node-32 specs, but now we’ll differentiate between nodes (e.g., node-11, node-12, node-13, node-14 have different CPU cores, memory, and no GPUs, while esxi-31, esxi-33, etc., have GPUs).\n",
    "If you want me to update the Python code from the previous response to incorporate these new node specs, I can modify it to handle heterogeneous nodes, GPU usage, and varying power consumption. Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with that or focus on something specific!\n",
    "Would you like me to proceed with updating the Python code, analyze a specific subset of nodes, or address any other aspect of this data? 😄\n",

    "Explanation of Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Node Specifications:\n",
    "Updated NODE_SPEC to include all nodes from your new list, with their respective CPU cores, memory, GPU details, and power consumption (Active, Idle, Standby).\n",
    "Sub-nodes (e.g., node-15, node-16, node-151–node-168) inherit memory and power from their parent ESXi hosts where not specified, as noted in the previous response.\n",
    "GPU memory is approximated (e.g., 11GB for RTX2080Ti, 12GB for RTX3080, 16GB for Tesla V100) for simplicity; adjust if actual values differ.\n",
    "Workload Data:\n",
    "Loaded the new workload data for 15:00–16:00 on November 4, 2024, with per-node CPU and GPU metrics.\n",
    "Assumed jobs persist for 1 hour (from 15:00 to 16:00), as per your start/end times.\n",
    "Classified jobs into AR (20%), IM (30%), and BE (50%) based on cpu_load for each node.\n",
    "EAVMAT Algorithm:\n",
    "Modified to handle heterogeneous nodes, checking CPU and GPU capacity for each node before scheduling.\n",
    "Prioritizes scheduling on the specific node listed in the workload, then falls back to other active/idle nodes if needed.\n",
    "Includes preemption for BE jobs to accommodate AR/IM jobs, as per the paper’s algorithm.\n",
    "Calculates energy consumption over 1 hour (60 minutes) instead of 4 hours, reflecting the new workload duration.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Reports total energy consumption (Watt-minutes), job success rate (%), and number of active hosts.\n",
    "Lists each node’s state, CPU usage, GPU power usage, and power consumption for debugging.\n",
    "Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Install required libraries:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy\n",
    "Save the script (e.g., eavmat_scheduler_updated.py) and run it:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "換行\n",
    "複製\n",
    "python eavmat_scheduler_updated.py\n",
    "Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will vary based on resource availability and scheduling decisions, but you might see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Energy Consumption: ~200,000–400,000 Watt-minutes (depending on active nodes and their power consumption).\n",
    "Job Success Rate: ~80–95% (depending on whether all jobs can be scheduled or require preemption).\n",
    "Number of Active Hosts: Likely 10–15 nodes, as many nodes have non-zero CPU loads at 15:00.\n",
    "Each node’s state, CPU usage, GPU power usage, and power consumption will be listed for detailed insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations and Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU Load: The GPU load calculation is simplified (e.g., gpu_power_used = job_load * 10). You can refine this based on actual GPU metrics (e.g., gpu_gpu_usage, gpu_mem_used).\n",
    "Sub-node Assumptions: Memory and power for sub-nodes (e.g., node-15, node-151) are assumed to match their parent ESXi hosts. Update if these differ.\n",
    "Job Classification: The 20%/30%/50% distribution for AR/IM/BE is assumed. Provide actual job types if available for more accuracy.\n",
    "Scalability: For larger workloads or more complex preemption rules, you might need to optimize the code or add VM-level scheduling.\n",
    "Let me know if you want to refine any part of this, add specific features, or analyze additional metrics! 😄\n",
